# Machine-Learning-Beginner
This repository contains a collection of basic Machine Learning projects coded in Python by me to learn the basics of Machine Learning.
The projects here do not use any Deep or Reinforcement Learning algorithms extensively, except in some cases where standard ML algorithms make no sense.
